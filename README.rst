    ``cd RRS4suadeTest``

run RRSserver on a separate terminal::
    ``python RRSserver.py``

run RRSclient on a separate terminal::
    ``python RRSclient.py``


not had the time to write tests, but they'd entail changing input params to RRSclient.py:

* Record : this is the record number being requested

* FileType: xml or pdf
